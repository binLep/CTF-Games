Thanks to your help, Eric and Vikram fixed their cells. Business is booming, and they¡¯re now a multinational megacorporation! They need bigger cells to meet demand: Eric used the rule ¡°sum8¡± to evolve his cells to their next stage of evolution! Sum8 sets each cell to the sum of the cells around it (see examples). Eric sent us his evolved cells, but we want to know what they looked like before! Can you turn back time and get the flag?
