The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) has got to go. Spencer just invented the Super Duper Advanced Encryption Standard (SDAES), and it¡¯s 100% unbreakable. AES only performs up to 14 rounds of substitution and permutation, while SDAES performs 10,000. That¡¯s so secure, SDAES doesn¡¯t even use a key!
