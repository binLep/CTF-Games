Reynholm Industries needed a system to issue notifications/messages for their employees. Maurice Moss, coding genius of The IT crowd, was assigned with the task to create one. The basic idea was that upper-level employees can create and view all the notifications. The lower-level employees shouldn't be able to read the confidential upper-level only notifications. Is Maurice really a coding genius ?<br>
