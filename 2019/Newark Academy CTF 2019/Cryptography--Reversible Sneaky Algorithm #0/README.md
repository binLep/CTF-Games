Yavan sent me these really large numbers¡­ what can they mean? He sent me the cipher ¡°c¡±, the private key ¡°d¡±, and the public modulus ¡°n¡±. I also know he converted his message to a number with ascii. For example:

¡°nactf¡± ¨C> \x6e61637466 ¨C> 474080310374

Can you help me decrypt his cipher?
