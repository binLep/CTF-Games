Apparently, Vikram was not satisfied with your work because he hired a new assistant: Eric. Eric has been doing a great job with managing the cells but he has allergies. Eric sneezed and accidentally messed up the order of the cells. Can you help Eric piece the cells back together?

btw, flag is all lowercase
