Dr. J was teaching Linear Algebra when he decided to buy some of Eric and Vik¡¯s cells! He cultivated the cells, drew a secret flag, and performed one step of ¡°sum8¡±. Luckily, he learned from Eric¡¯s mistake and added random 0¡¯s, 1¡¯s, and 2¡¯s in the background so nobody can reverse the message. Can you still get the flag?
