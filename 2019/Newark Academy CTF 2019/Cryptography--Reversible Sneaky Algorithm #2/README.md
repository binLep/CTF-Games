Oligar was thinking about number theory at AwesomeMath when he decided to encrypt a message with RSA. As a mathematician, he made various observations about the numbers. He told Molly one such observation:

a^r ¡Ô 1 (mod n)

He isn¡¯t SHOR if he accidentally revealed anything by telling Molly this fact¡­ can you decrypt his message?

Source code, a and r, public key, and ciphertext are attached.
