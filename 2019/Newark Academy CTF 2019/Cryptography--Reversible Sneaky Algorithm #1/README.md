Lori decided to implement RSA without any security measures like random padding. Must be deterministic then, huh? Silly goose!

She encrypted a message of the form nactf{****} where the redacted flag is a string of 4 lowercase alphabetical characters. Can you decrypt it?

As in the previous problem, the message is converted to a number by converting ascii to hex.
